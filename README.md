# BashRC
My bash RC file.

-Before editing your ***~/.bashrc*** file, make sure to install ***starship***. If you are on an Arch intall, run ***sudo pacman -S starship***. If you are on a Debian system, run ***sudo apt install starship***. 

# Editing the ~/.bashrc file
First, run ***sudo pacman -S nano***, then ***sudo nano ~/.bashrc***. When in there, paste there all the code from my ***bashrc.sh*** file. CTRL+O tp save the file, then CTRL+X to exit. Reboot the system, and you're good to go!
